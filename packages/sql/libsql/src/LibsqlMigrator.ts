/**
 * Utilities for applying Effect SQL migrations to libSQL and Turso databases.
 *
 * This module re-exports the shared `Migrator` loaders and error types, then
 * provides `run` and `layer` helpers for applying ordered migrations through the
 * current libSQL-backed `SqlClient`. It is typically used at application
 * startup, in deployment or setup scripts for Turso databases, in tests that
 * create temporary `file:` databases, or in layer graphs that must ensure the
 * schema exists before dependent services are acquired.
 *
 * Migrations are recorded in `effect_sql_migrations` by default and are loaded
 * using the shared `<id>_<name>` file or record-key convention. Because libSQL
 * uses SQLite-compatible SQL, migrations should avoid dialect features that are
 * not supported by libSQL or the configured Turso deployment. Remote Turso
 * databases, local `file:` databases, and embedded replicas can each observe
 * different state until replication has caught up, so run schema-changing
 * migrations against the intended writer and wait for replicas to sync before
 * serving code that depends on the new schema. Concurrent migrators rely on the
 * migrations table primary key to detect races, and this adapter does not
 * currently write schema dumps for `schemaDirectory`.
