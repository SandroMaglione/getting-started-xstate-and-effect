/**
 * Browser entry-point helpers for running Effect programs.
 *
 * This module exposes `runMain`, a browser-oriented main runner for launching
 * an Effect as the root program of a page, single-page application, demo, or
 * browser test harness. It delegates execution to the core Effect runtime while
 * adding the browser lifecycle hook needed to interrupt the main fiber when the
 * page receives `beforeunload`.
 *
 * `BrowserRuntime` does not provide application services by itself. Provide
 * any required layers, such as browser HTTP, storage, worker, geolocation, or
 * permission services, before passing the effect to `runMain`. Keep long-lived
 * browser resources scoped so interruption can run their finalizers while the
 * page is still active.
 *
 * Browser unload is more constrained than a process signal. Finalizers that
 * need the network, timers, prompts, or long asynchronous work may not complete
 * once navigation or tab close has started, and browsers do not expose a
 * process exit status. Use `runMain` to connect the page lifecycle to Effect
 * interruption, and use browser-specific persistence or delivery APIs for work
 * that must survive page teardown.
 *
