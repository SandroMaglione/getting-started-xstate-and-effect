/**
 * Parent-side browser support for Effect workers.
 *
 * This module provides the `WorkerPlatform` used by browser applications that
 * spawn or connect to `Worker`, `SharedWorker`, and `MessagePort` endpoints
 * through Effect's worker protocol. Pair it with `BrowserWorkerRunner` in the
 * worker entrypoint when building worker-backed RPC clients, moving CPU-bound
 * work off the main thread, isolating browser-only services, or adapting an
 * existing `MessageChannel` in tests and custom transports.
 *
 * Dedicated workers communicate through the worker object itself, while shared
 * workers communicate through `worker.port`; raw `MessagePort` values are also
 * accepted and are started when supported. Messages are posted with the browser
 * structured-clone algorithm, so payloads must be cloneable by the target
 * runtime. Transfer lists can avoid copying values such as `ArrayBuffer` or
 * `MessagePort`, but transferring moves ownership away from the sender and
 * invalid or mismatched transferables can fail the send. Scope finalization
 * sends the worker close signal over the port; the application that created a
 * dedicated `Worker` remains responsible for any broader lifecycle such as
 * terminating it.
 *
