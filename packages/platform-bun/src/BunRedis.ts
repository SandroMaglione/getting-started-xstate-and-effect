/**
 * Bun Redis integration backed by Bun's built-in `RedisClient`.
 *
 * This module provides scoped layers that create a Bun `RedisClient` and expose
 * both the low-level `Redis` service used by Effect persistence modules and the
 * `BunRedis` service for direct access to the underlying client. Use it in Bun
 * applications that need Redis-backed persistence, persisted queues,
 * distributed rate limiting, custom Redis commands, or Bun Redis features such
 * as pub/sub through the raw client.
 *
 * The client is acquired when the layer is built and closed with `close` when
 * the layer scope ends, so install the layer at the lifetime you want for the
 * connection and pass a Redis URL, Bun `RedisOptions`, or `layerConfig` for
 * connection settings. The portable `Redis` service sends ordinary commands
 * through `RedisClient.send`; pub/sub is available through `BunRedis.client`
 * or `BunRedis.use` and should normally use a separately scoped client so a
 * subscription does not interfere with command traffic used by persistence or
 * rate limiter stores.
 *
 * Persistence and rate limiter stores build keys and Lua scripts on top of this
 * service. Choose stable prefixes and store ids to avoid collisions, account
 * for persisted values that may fail to decode after schema changes, and avoid
 * unbounded high-cardinality rate-limit keys unless you have a cleanup or
 * bounding strategy.
