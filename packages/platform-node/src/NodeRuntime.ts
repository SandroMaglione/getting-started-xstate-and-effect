/**
 * Node.js entry-point helpers for running Effect programs.
 *
 * This module exposes `runMain`, the Node runtime launcher used at the edge of
 * CLI tools, scripts, servers, and worker processes. It runs an already
 * self-contained Effect as the process main program, with built-in error
 * reporting and Node signal handling.
 *
 * `NodeRuntime` does not provide application services by itself. Provide any
 * required layers, such as `NodeServices.layer` or narrower service-specific
 * layers, before passing the effect to `runMain`. On `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`,
 * the main fiber is interrupted so scoped resources and finalizers can shut
 * down; keep long-running work attached to that scope and avoid finalizers that
 * never complete, otherwise process shutdown can be delayed.

/**
 * Helps you run a main effect with built-in error handling, logging, and signal management.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function launches an Effect as the main entry point, setting exit codes
 * based on success or failure, handling interrupts (e.g., Ctrl+C), and optionally
 * logging errors. By default, it logs errors and uses a "pretty" format, but both
 * behaviors can be turned off. You can also provide custom teardown logic to
 * finalize resources or produce different exit codes.
 *
 * **Options**
 *
 * An optional object that can include:
 * - `disableErrorReporting`: Turn off automatic error logging.
 * - `teardown`: Provide custom finalization logic.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function to run an Effect as your application’s main program, especially
 * when you need structured error handling, log management, interrupt support,
 * or advanced teardown capabilities.
