/**
 * The `Effectable` module provides low-level building blocks for defining
 * custom values that behave like `Effect`s. It is primarily used by library
 * authors who need domain-specific effect-like data types, such as service
 * keys, configuration descriptions, prompts, or other declarative programs
 * that can be yielded inside `Effect.gen`.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - `Effectable` does not run effects by itself; it provides prototypes that
 *   implement the internal Effect protocol.
 * - {@link Prototype} creates a primitive Effect prototype with a custom
 *   evaluation function that receives the current `Fiber`.
 * - {@link Class} is an abstract base class for defining custom classes whose
 *   instances are also `Effect` values.
 * - The success, error, and service requirements of the custom type are
 *   preserved through the `Effect.Effect<A, E, R>` type parameters.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Build an effect-like interface around a declarative data structure.
 * - Implement a custom `evaluate` hook that interprets the value in terms of
 *   the current fiber and returns the underlying `Effect`.
 * - Extend {@link Class} when a nominal class-based API is more convenient
 *   than manually wiring a prototype.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - This module is intentionally low-level; most application code should use
 *   `Effect` constructors and combinators instead.
 * - `evaluate` must return an `Effect` with the same success, error, and
 *   service types as the custom value.
 * - Because these APIs participate in the internal Effect protocol, keep
 *   implementations small and follow existing modules such as `Config` and
 *   `Context` when adding new effect-like types.
