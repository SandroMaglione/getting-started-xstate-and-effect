/**
 * Durable workflow clocks provide workflow-safe timers and sleep operations.
 *
 * Use this module when a workflow needs to pause until a timeout, reminder,
 * deadline, retry delay, or other scheduled wake-up. Short sleeps can run as
 * in-memory activities, while longer sleeps are scheduled with the workflow
 * engine and resumed through a durable deferred signal when the timer fires.
 *
 * Because workflows may be replayed, timer names and durations should be
 * deterministic and stable for a given workflow path. Avoid deriving them from
 * ambient wall-clock state, and give distinct sleeps distinct names so replayed
 * executions can be matched with the correct scheduled wake-up. Lower the
 * in-memory threshold when a delay must be handled by the workflow engine
 * rather than the current process.
