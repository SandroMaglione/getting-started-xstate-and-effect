/**
 * Typed error definitions for the unstable worker APIs.
 *
 * `WorkerError` is the shared error channel for `WorkerPlatform` and
 * `WorkerRunnerPlatform` implementations. The nested reason identifies where a
 * platform failure happened: spawning or setting up a worker, sending through
 * `postMessage`, receiving worker events, or handling a runtime-specific
 * failure that does not fit the other categories. This is useful when building
 * worker-backed RPC clients and servers, implementing a platform adapter, or
 * recovering differently from startup, transport, and worker-exit failures.
 *
 * Worker transports cross browser, Node, Bun, and child-process runtimes, so the
 * original cause is best treated as diagnostic data. Spawn failures can mean the
 * runner is not actually executing inside a worker context, send failures often
 * come from structured-clone or transfer-list problems, and receive failures
 * may be reported as `messageerror`, `error`, or exit events depending on the
 * runtime. The `WorkerErrorReason` schema supports encoding and decoding the
 * tagged reasons, but message payloads still need to be valid for the selected
 * worker protocol and runtime.
