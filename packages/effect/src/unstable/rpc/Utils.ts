/**
 * Internal helpers for constructing RPC protocol services whose receive loop is
 * installed separately from the operations that write to it.
 *
 * This module is used by the client and server `Protocol.make` constructors to
 * let transports expose a stable service immediately while buffering messages
 * until the protocol's `run` method has installed the active receiver. Buffered
 * writes keep the `Context` that was current at the time of the write, so
 * replaying early messages preserves fiber-local services such as tracing or
 * request metadata.
 *
 * The general `withRun` helper is for single receive-loop services, such as
 * server transports, while `withRunClient` specializes the same pattern for
 * client transports by tracking active client ids and keeping a separate buffer
 * per client. They are most useful when implementing custom RPC transports or
 * test protocols that need to send before the consumer fiber has started.
 *
 * These helpers intentionally work on `Omit<Service, "run">` and re-add `run`
 * so generated `Context.Service` static `make` members can preserve their
 * exact service shape. When using them from generated or type-helper-heavy
 * protocol code, keep the `run` signature aligned with the target service:
 * the server helper has one shared writer, but the client helper requires a
 * `clientId` because responses and buffered messages are routed per client.
