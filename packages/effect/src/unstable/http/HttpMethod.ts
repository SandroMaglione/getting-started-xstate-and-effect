/**
 * Defines the supported HTTP method literals shared by the unstable HTTP client,
 * server, and routing APIs.
 *
 * Use this module when constructing method-specific requests, matching incoming
 * requests, validating unknown method values, or deriving method helper names.
 * Methods are represented as uppercase string literals, so values such as `"get"`
 * are not accepted as `HttpMethod` values.
 *
 * The body classification is intentionally conservative and file-specific:
 * `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `TRACE` are modeled as bodyless methods, while
 * `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH` are modeled as methods that can carry a
 * request body. This means `DELETE` is allowed to carry a body even though some
 * servers and intermediaries may ignore it, and `GET` request bodies are not
 * represented by these helpers even though the wire protocol does not strictly
 * forbid them.
