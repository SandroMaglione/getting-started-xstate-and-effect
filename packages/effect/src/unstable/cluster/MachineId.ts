/**
 * The `MachineId` module provides the branded integer identifier used to
 * distinguish cluster runners when generating distributed ids and coordinating
 * runner state.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * - Persisting or exchanging the machine id assigned to a cluster runner
 * - Passing a runner-specific identity to the cluster snowflake generator
 * - Decoding machine ids from storage while keeping them distinct from plain numbers
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Machine ids must be unique for concurrently active runners that generate snowflakes
 * - Snowflake ids store the machine component in 10 bits, so only the value modulo 1024 is encoded
