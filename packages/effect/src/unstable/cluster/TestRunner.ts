/**
 * The `TestRunner` module provides a lightweight in-memory cluster layer for
 * tests that need the cluster sharding services without starting real runners
 * or relying on external storage.
 *
 * Use it when exercising sharding behavior, message storage, or code that
 * depends on the cluster runner services in unit and integration tests. The
 * layer wires the normal sharding service to in-memory message and runner
 * storage, along with no-op runner and health implementations.
 *
 * **Testing gotchas**
 *
 * - State is held in memory and scoped to the layer lifetime; it is not shared
 *   across independently constructed layers or persisted between test runs
 * - Runner execution and health checks are no-ops, so this layer is best suited
 *   for testing coordination and storage behavior rather than real distributed
 *   runner processes
