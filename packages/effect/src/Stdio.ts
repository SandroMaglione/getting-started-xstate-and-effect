/**
 * The `Stdio` module defines the service interface used by Effect programs to
 * interact with process standard I/O. It models command-line arguments,
 * standard output, standard error, and standard input as Effects, Sinks, and
 * Streams so programs can depend on console I/O through `Context` instead of
 * directly coupling to a specific runtime.
 *
 * Use this module when building command-line programs, tests, or platform
 * integrations that need to read bytes from stdin, write text or bytes to
 * stdout/stderr, or provide deterministic replacements for those capabilities.
 * The `layerTest` helper is useful for tests because it supplies inert defaults
 * and lets individual fields be overridden.
 *
 * Standard I/O operations are platform capabilities and may fail with
 * `PlatformError`; handle those failures in the Effect error channel rather than
 * assuming writes or reads are infallible.
