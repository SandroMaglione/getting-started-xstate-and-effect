/**
 * The `Latch` module provides a reusable synchronization primitive for
 * coordinating fibers. A `Latch` is either open or closed: when it is closed,
 * fibers that use {@link await} or {@link whenOpen} suspend until the latch is
 * opened or the current waiters are released.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - An open latch lets current and future waiters continue immediately
 * - A closed latch causes `await` and `whenOpen` to suspend
 * - {@link open} permanently opens the latch until it is closed again
 * - {@link release} wakes only the fibers currently waiting and leaves the
 *   latch closed for future waiters
 * - {@link close} resets the latch so later waiters suspend again
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a latch inside `Effect`: {@link make}
 * - Create a latch synchronously: {@link makeUnsafe}
 * - Wait for a signal before continuing: {@link await}
 * - Guard an effect so it runs only after the latch is open: {@link whenOpen}
 * - Let all current and future waiters proceed: {@link open}
 * - Let only the current waiters proceed: {@link release}
 * - Re-enable waiting after opening: {@link close}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `release` is not the same as `open`; new waiters still suspend after the
 *   current waiters are released
 * - `open` and `close` report whether they changed the latch state
 * - Prefer the effectful APIs unless synchronous allocation or mutation is
 *   required

/**
 * A reusable coordination primitive that lets fibers wait until they are
 * released by the latch.
 *
 * A closed latch causes `await` and `whenOpen` to suspend. `open` opens the
 * latch and releases current and future waiters, `release` releases only
 * current waiters without opening it, and `close` makes future waiters suspend
 * again.
 *
 * **Example** (Coordinating fibers with a latch)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Latch } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create and use a latch for coordination between fibers
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const latch = yield* Latch.make()
 *
 *   // Wait for the latch to be opened
 *   yield* latch.await
 *
 *   return "Latch was opened!"
 * })
 * ```
