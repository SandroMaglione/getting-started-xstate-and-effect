/**
 * Browser `Stream` constructors for DOM event targets.
 *
 * This module provides typed helpers for turning `window.addEventListener` and
 * `document.addEventListener` callbacks into Effect `Stream`s. They are useful
 * for UI and runtime signals such as resize, visibility, keyboard, pointer,
 * focus, online / offline, and other browser events that should be composed
 * with Effect stream operators and finalized with the consuming fiber.
 *
 * Browser events are push-based `EventTarget` notifications, so they do not
 * apply Web Streams backpressure to the browser event source. Events are
 * buffered until downstream pulls them; the default buffer is unbounded, so
 * high-frequency sources like scroll, pointermove, or mousemove should usually
 * set `bufferSize` and use stream operators that sample, debounce, throttle, or
 * drop work as appropriate.
 *
 * These helpers are for DOM events, not for adapting `ReadableStream` request
 * or response bodies. Fetch bodies follow the Web Streams body rules, including
 * single-consumer locking and disturbed bodies after reads, and should be
 * handled with body-specific HTTP or Web Streams APIs instead. When using the
 * browser `once` option, pair the stream with `Stream.take(1)` if a finite
 * stream is required.
