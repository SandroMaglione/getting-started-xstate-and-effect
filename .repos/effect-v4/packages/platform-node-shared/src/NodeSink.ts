/**
 * Sink adapters for writing Effect stream chunks into Node writable streams.
 *
 * This module is used at the boundary where Effect `Stream`s or `Channel`s need
 * to push data into Node's writable side: file streams, HTTP request or
 * response bodies, process stdio, sockets, and transform inputs such as
 * compression or encryption streams. It exposes both a `Sink` constructor for
 * ordinary stream pipelines and lower-level `Channel` and pull helpers used by
 * other Node stream adapters.
 *
 * The implementation follows Node writable semantics. Chunks are written in
 * order; when `write` returns `false`, pulling pauses until `drain` so upstream
 * producers do not overrun the writable buffer. Writable `error` events are
 * mapped through `onError`, and the writable is ended and awaited via `finish`
 * when upstream completes unless `endOnDone` is `false`. Use `endOnDone: false`
 * for externally owned or long-lived writables, and make sure `onError` keeps
 * Node's untyped errors meaningful for the calling Effect workflow.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
