/**
 * Shared runtime helpers for running Effect programs as Node-compatible
 * process entry points.
 *
 * This module provides the common `runMain` implementation used by
 * Node-compatible platform packages. It is intended for CLIs, scripts,
 * workers, servers, and other process-oriented programs that should run an
 * Effect as their main fiber while still following Node process conventions.
 *
 * The runner installs `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` handlers for the lifetime of the
 * main fiber, translating those process signals into fiber interruption so
 * Effect finalizers and the configured teardown can run. When the fiber exits,
 * the signal listeners are removed and teardown determines the exit code. Clean
 * success lets the Node event loop drain naturally instead of forcing
 * `process.exit(0)`, while signal-triggered or non-zero exits call
 * `process.exit` after teardown, so long-running resources should be modeled
 * in the Effect scope and finalized explicitly.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
