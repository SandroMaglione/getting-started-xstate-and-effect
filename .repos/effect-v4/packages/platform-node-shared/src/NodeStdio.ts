/**
 * Shared Node.js implementation of the Effect `Stdio` service.
 *
 * This module builds the `Stdio` layer used by Node platform packages by
 * wiring the service to the current process: command-line arguments come from
 * `process.argv`, input is read from `process.stdin`, and output and error
 * output are written to `process.stdout` and `process.stderr`. It is intended
 * for CLIs, scripts, command runners, test harnesses, and other
 * process-oriented programs that need standard I/O through Effect services.
 *
 * The process stdio streams are global resources owned by Node. This layer
 * leaves stdin open and does not end stdout or stderr by default, avoiding
 * accidental closure of handles other code in the process may still use. Those
 * streams may be pipes, files, or TTYs; interactive terminal behavior such as
 * raw mode, echo, colors, and cursor movement should be coordinated with the
 * terminal APIs instead of assuming this layer has exclusive control.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
