/**
 * The `BunClusterSocket` module provides the Bun socket transport for Effect
 * Cluster runners. It wires `SocketRunner` to Bun-compatible TCP sockets,
 * supplies RPC client and server protocol layers, and builds a complete
 * sharding layer with serialization, runner health, runner storage, and message
 * storage.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Run a Bun process as a cluster runner over raw TCP sockets with
 *   {@link layer}
 * - Connect a client-only process to an existing socket cluster without
 *   starting a runner server
 * - Use SQL-backed storage for durable multi-process clusters, `local` storage
 *   for short-lived development, or `byo` storage when the deployment owns the
 *   persistence boundary
 * - Check runner health with socket pings or Kubernetes pod readiness through
 *   {@link layerK8sHttpClient}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `runnerAddress` is the host and port advertised to other runners; set
 *   `runnerListenAddress` when the local bind address differs from the
 *   externally reachable address
 * - The socket transport is point-to-point RPC, not cluster gossip: runner
 *   membership, shard ownership, and persisted delivery are coordinated through
 *   `RunnerStorage`, `MessageStorage`, and `RunnerHealth`
 * - `clientOnly` does not start a socket server or receive shard assignments
 * - SQL storage is the default; `local` storage is in-memory/noop and `byo`
 *   requires the surrounding application to provide both runner and message
 *   storage services
 * - Ping health checks use the same socket protocol, so unreachable ports,
 *   firewalls, or serialization mismatches can make a runner appear unhealthy
 * - Kubernetes health checks use Bun's Fetch-backed HTTP client and the service
 *   account CA certificate when it is available
