/**
 * Bun implementation of the Effect HTTP platform service.
 *
 * This module connects the portable `HttpPlatform` file response helpers to
 * Bun's Web-compatible runtime. `BunHttpServer` provides this layer when
 * applications serve local files, public assets, downloads, byte ranges, or
 * Web `File` values from Effect `HttpServerResponse` constructors.
 *
 * Path-based responses are backed by `Bun.file`, and Web `File` responses are
 * returned directly as raw response bodies. The shared `HttpPlatform` service
 * still computes file metadata such as ETags and last-modified headers, while
 * this adapter lets Bun's `Response` implementation handle the platform body.
 *
 * Because the Bun server adapter sits on top of Web `Request` and `Response`,
 * request bodies follow the usual single-consumption rules: choose the
 * streamed, text, URL-encoded, or multipart view that matches the route. For
 * `FormData` responses, let the `Response` constructor create the multipart
 * content type and boundary unless you intentionally override it. File
 * responses take filesystem paths, not request URLs; Bun request URLs are
 * absolute at the runtime edge, and route paths are normalized by
 * `BunHttpServer`, so decode and validate URL pathnames before mapping them to
 * files.
