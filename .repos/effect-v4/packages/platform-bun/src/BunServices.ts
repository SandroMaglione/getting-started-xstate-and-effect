/**
 * Provides the aggregate Bun platform services layer for applications that run
 * on the Bun runtime.
 *
 * This module is useful when an application needs the standard Bun-backed
 * implementations of filesystem access, path operations, stdio, terminal
 * interaction, and child process spawning from a single layer. Provide
 * `BunServices.layer` near the edge of a program to satisfy effects that read
 * or write files, resolve paths, interact with stdin/stdout/stderr or a
 * terminal, or launch subprocesses.
 *
 * The layer only supplies the runtime services listed by `BunServices`; it does
 * not provide unrelated platform services such as HTTP clients, HTTP servers,
 * sockets, workers, or Redis. Several of these core Bun services are backed by
 * the shared Node-compatible implementations used by the Bun adapters, so the
 * default path, stdio, terminal, and subprocess behavior follows the current
 * process and host platform. Libraries should continue to depend on the
 * individual service tags they use, while Bun applications, CLIs, and tests can
 * choose this layer or narrower service-specific layers depending on how much
 * of the Bun runtime they want to expose.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
