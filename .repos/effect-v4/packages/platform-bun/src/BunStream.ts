/**
 * Bun stream interoperability for Effect streams.
 *
 * This module provides Bun-specific adapters for working with streaming data at
 * the boundary between Bun APIs and Effect. It re-exports the shared Node stream
 * adapters for Bun's Node-compatible stream APIs, and adds an optimized
 * `ReadableStream` constructor that uses Bun's `readMany` support to pull
 * batches of Web Stream values into an Effect `Stream`.
 *
 * Common uses include adapting Bun `Request` and `Response` bodies, multipart
 * uploads, and other Web `ReadableStream` sources so they can be transformed,
 * decoded, or piped with Effect stream operators. Pulling from the Effect stream
 * drives reads from the underlying reader, while Bun and the Web Streams runtime
 * still control their own internal buffering and source backpressure.
 *
 * Web `ReadableStream` readers take an exclusive lock on the source. Request and
 * response bodies are also one-shot: once consumed they become disturbed and
 * should not be read through another API. The adapter cancels the reader when
 * the consuming scope is finalized by default; set `releaseLockOnEnd` when the
 * stream is externally owned and should only have its lock released. Read errors
 * are mapped through the provided `onError` function.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
