/**
 * Node.js implementation of the Effect HTTP platform service.
 *
 * This module connects the portable `HttpPlatform` file response helpers to
 * Node runtime primitives. It is used by Node HTTP servers and static file
 * handlers when returning local files, public assets, downloads, byte ranges,
 * or Web `File` values as `HttpServerResponse` bodies.
 *
 * Path-based responses are served with `node:fs.createReadStream`; Web `File`
 * responses are bridged with `Readable.fromWeb`. The implementation fills in
 * `content-type` from `Mime`, falls back to `application/octet-stream`, and
 * writes the `content-length` for the selected range or whole file. Node's
 * stream `end` option is inclusive, so the platform converts Effect's half-open
 * range before reading. Empty bodies use an empty readable stream.
 *
 * Provide `layer` at the Node runtime edge when file responses, static serving,
 * or response bodies created from files need real filesystem and ETag support.
 * These responses are raw Node streams, so they are intended for the Node HTTP
 * server adapter; keep files available until the response body has been
 * consumed and prefer the portable `HttpServerResponse` constructors when a
 * response does not depend on Node file or stream behavior.
