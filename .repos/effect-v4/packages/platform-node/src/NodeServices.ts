/**
 * Provides the aggregate Node platform services layer for applications that run
 * on the Node.js runtime.
 *
 * This module is useful when an application needs the standard Node-backed
 * implementations of filesystem access, path operations, stdio, terminal
 * interaction, and child process spawning from a single layer. Provide
 * `NodeServices.layer` near the edge of a program to satisfy effects that read
 * or write files, resolve paths, interact with stdin/stdout/stderr or a
 * terminal, or launch subprocesses.
 *
 * The layer only supplies the runtime services listed by `NodeServices`; it does
 * not provide unrelated platform services such as HTTP clients or servers.
 * Libraries should continue to depend on the individual service tags they use,
 * while applications, CLIs, and tests can choose this layer or narrower
 * service-specific layers depending on how much of the Node runtime they want to
 * expose.
