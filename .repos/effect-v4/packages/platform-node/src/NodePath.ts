/**
 * Node.js layers for Effect's `Path` service.
 *
 * Use this module when an Effect program running on Node needs path operations
 * from the `Path` service, such as joining and normalizing filesystem
 * locations, resolving configuration or static asset paths, working with CLI
 * path arguments, or converting between file paths and `file:` URLs.
 *
 * `layer` follows the host platform's `node:path` semantics. Use `layerPosix`
 * or `layerWin32` when code needs stable POSIX or Windows behavior regardless
 * of the operating system. These layers provide only path manipulation; they do
 * not read the filesystem or validate that paths exist. `NodeServices.layer`
 * already includes the default Node path layer, so provide this module directly
 * when you want the narrower service or one of the platform-specific variants.
 *
