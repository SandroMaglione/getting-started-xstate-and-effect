/**
 * The `Terminal` module defines the service interface used by platform
 * integrations to model command-line input and output. It gives programs a
 * uniform way to query terminal dimensions, read lines, stream low-level key
 * events, and write text without depending directly on Node, the browser, or a
 * test-specific console implementation.
 *
 * Use this module when building interactive command-line tools, prompts, or
 * platform abstractions that need terminal capabilities as an Effect service.
 * Implementations are supplied through context, so application code can depend
 * on `Terminal` while tests and runtimes provide the concrete behavior.
 *
 * `readLine` can fail with {@link QuitError} when the user requests to quit,
 * commonly via `Ctrl+C`. For lower-level interaction, `readInput` returns a
 * scoped stream of {@link UserInput} values containing parsed key metadata and
 * any raw character input.
