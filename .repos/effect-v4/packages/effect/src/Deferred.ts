/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Deferred`, a powerful concurrency
 * primitive that represents an asynchronous variable that can be set exactly once.
 * Multiple fibers can await the same `Deferred` and will all be notified when it
 * completes.
 *
 * A `Deferred<A, E>` can be:
 * - **Completed successfully** with a value of type `A`
 * - **Failed** with an error of type `E`
 * - **Interrupted** if the fiber setting it is interrupted
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - **Single assignment**: Can only be completed once
 * - **Multiple waiters**: Many fibers can await the same `Deferred`
 * - **Fiber-safe**: Thread-safe operations across concurrent fibers
 * - **Composable**: Works seamlessly with other Effect operations
 *
 * **Example** (Coordinating fibers with a Deferred)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Deferred, Effect, Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic usage: coordinate between fibers
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const deferred = yield* Deferred.make<string, never>()
 *
 *   // Fiber 1: waits for the value
 *   const waiter = yield* Effect.forkChild(
 *     Effect.gen(function*() {
 *       const value = yield* Deferred.await(deferred)
 *       console.log("Received:", value)
 *       return value
 *     })
 *   )
 *
 *   // Fiber 2: sets the value after a delay
 *   const setter = yield* Effect.forkChild(
 *     Effect.gen(function*() {
 *       yield* Effect.sleep("1 second")
 *       yield* Deferred.succeed(deferred, "Hello from setter!")
 *     })
 *   )
 *
 *   // Wait for both fibers
 *   yield* Fiber.join(waiter)
 *   yield* Fiber.join(setter)
 * })
 *
 * // Producer-consumer pattern
 * const producerConsumer = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const buffer = yield* Deferred.make<Array<number>, never>()
 *
 *   const producer = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *     const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 *     yield* Deferred.succeed(buffer, data)
 *   })
 *
 *   const consumer = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *     const data = yield* Deferred.await(buffer)
 *     return data.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0)
 *   })
 *
 *   const [, result] = yield* Effect.all([producer, consumer])
 *   return result // 15
 * })
 * ```

/**
 * A `Deferred` represents an asynchronous variable that can be set exactly
 * once, with the ability for an arbitrary number of fibers to suspend (by
 * calling `Deferred.await`) and automatically resume when the variable is set.
 *
 * `Deferred` can be used for building primitive actions whose completions
 * require the coordinated action of multiple fibers, and for building
 * higher-level concurrent or asynchronous structures.
 *
 * **Example** (Creating a Deferred for inter-fiber communication)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Deferred, Effect, Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create and use a Deferred for inter-fiber communication
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   // Create a Deferred that will hold a string value
 *   const deferred: Deferred.Deferred<string> = yield* Deferred.make<string>()
 *
 *   // Fork a fiber that will set the deferred value
 *   const producer = yield* Effect.forkChild(
 *     Effect.gen(function*() {

 *       yield* Deferred.succeed(deferred, "Hello, World!")

 * as the attempted completion. The returned effect cannot fail; it succeeds
 * with `true` if it completed the `Deferred`, or `false` if the `Deferred` was
 * already completed.
 *
 * **Example** (Completing a Deferred from an effect result)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Deferred, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Define an effect that succeeds
 * const successEffect = Effect.succeed(42)
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   // Create a deferred
 *   const deferred = yield* Deferred.make<number, string>()
 *
 *   // Complete the deferred using the successEffect
 *   const isCompleted = yield* Deferred.into(successEffect, deferred)
 *
 *   // Access the value of the deferred
 *   const value = yield* Deferred.await(deferred)
 *   console.log(value)
 *
 *   return isCompleted
 * })
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 42
 * // true
 * ```
