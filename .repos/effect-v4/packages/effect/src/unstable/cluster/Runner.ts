/**
 * The `Runner` module defines the membership record used by the unstable
 * cluster runtime to describe a process that can host entity shards.
 *
 * A runner combines the network address used by other runners to reach it, the
 * shard groups it participates in, and a relative weight used when the sharding
 * service assigns shards across the healthy runners in each group.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Construct the runner registered by the local `Sharding` layer
 * - Persist or exchange runner metadata through `RunnerStorage`
 * - Encode and decode runner values at cluster transport or storage boundaries
 * - Tune shard distribution by adjusting the runner's group membership and
 *   relative weight
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Runner addresses must be stable and unique while a runner is registered,
 *   because they identify the owner used for routing and shard locks.
 * - Weights are relative within each shard group; changing weights or groups can
 *   rebalance shard ownership as the cluster refreshes its runner view.
 * - Runner equality and hashing are based on address and weight, so compare
 *   `groups` explicitly when group membership is the important distinction.
