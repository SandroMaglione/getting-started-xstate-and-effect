/**
 * The `EntityResource` module provides helpers for acquiring resources inside a
 * cluster entity and keeping them available across entity restarts. It is useful
 * for long-lived resources tied to an entity address, such as external
 * processes, network clients, Kubernetes Pods, or other handles that should not
 * be torn down during routine shard movement.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create a reusable entity-scoped resource with {@link make}
 * - Keep an entity alive while the resource is acquired
 * - Explicitly release the resource with `EntityResource.close`
 * - Attach cleanup work to the resource close scope with {@link CloseScope}
 * - Create and manage a Kubernetes Pod resource with {@link makeK8sPod}
 *
 * **Lifecycle gotchas**
 *
 * - Resources are retained by an `RcRef` and are only fully released after
 *   `idleTimeToLive` expires or `close` is called
 * - The default idle time to live is infinite, so resources remain alive until
 *   explicitly closed
 * - `CloseScope` is separate from the caller scope and is not closed by entity
 *   restarts, shard movement, or node shutdown finalization
