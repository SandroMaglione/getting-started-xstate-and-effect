/**
 * The `SocketRunner` module wires cluster runner RPCs to socket transports. It
 * provides a complete runner layer that serves RPC handlers on a `SocketServer`
 * and installs `Sharding` and `Runners` clients for talking to other runners
 * through the socket RPC protocol.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Run a cluster worker over TCP or Unix sockets with {@link layer}
 * - Connect to other runners while exposing `Sharding` and `Runners` clients
 * - Embed a client-only cluster participant with {@link layerClientOnly} when
 *   the process should send messages but not receive shard assignments
 *
 * **Transport gotchas**
 *
 * - The server listen address comes from the provided `SocketServer` and is
 *   logged when {@link layer} starts
 * - TCP addresses are logged as `hostname:port`, while Unix socket addresses
 *   are logged as their filesystem path
 * - The client-only layer does not start a socket server; provide the full
 *   layer when the process must accept runner RPCs
 *
