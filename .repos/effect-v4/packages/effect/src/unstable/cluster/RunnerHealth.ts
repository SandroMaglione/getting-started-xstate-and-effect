/**
 * The `RunnerHealth` module defines the health-check service used by cluster
 * sharding to decide whether a runner may still own its assigned shards. A
 * runner that is reported as alive is allowed to keep processing messages,
 * while a runner that is reported as unavailable can have its shards moved to
 * another runner.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Provide a custom {@link RunnerHealth} service for a cluster deployment
 * - Use {@link layerPing} to check runners through the cluster runner protocol
 * - Use {@link layerK8s} when Kubernetes pod readiness should drive health
 * - Use {@link layerNoop} in tests or environments where runners are always considered healthy
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Health checks affect shard reassignment, so false negatives can move shards
 *   away from runners that may still be processing messages
 * - The Kubernetes implementation treats API failures as healthy to avoid
 *   reassignment caused by a temporary control-plane outage
