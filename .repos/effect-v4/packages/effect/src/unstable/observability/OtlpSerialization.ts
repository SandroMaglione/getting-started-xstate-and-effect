/**
 * Defines the serialization boundary used by the OTLP observability layers.
 *
 * `OtlpSerialization` converts Effect's in-memory OTLP trace, metric, and log
 * data into `HttpBody` values so exporters can send them to collectors over
 * OTLP/HTTP. Use this module to choose between the JSON encoding that is useful
 * for debugging and collector endpoints that explicitly accept OTLP/HTTP JSON,
 * and the protobuf encoding commonly expected by production OpenTelemetry
 * collectors.
 *
 * The JSON layer writes the telemetry structures directly with
 * `HttpBody.jsonUnsafe`; the protobuf layer encodes the same structures with
 * the internal OTLP protobuf encoder and sets the `application/x-protobuf`
 * content type. Endpoint paths, authentication headers, batching, retries, and
 * shutdown flushing are handled by the OTLP exporter layers that consume this
 * service, while this module focuses only on preserving the wire format chosen
 * for traces, metrics, and logs.
