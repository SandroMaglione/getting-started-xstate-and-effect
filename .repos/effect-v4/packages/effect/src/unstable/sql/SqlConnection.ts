/**
 * Defines the low-level SQL connection service and shared row/acquirer types
 * used by Effect's unstable SQL driver integrations.
 *
 * A `Connection` is the driver-facing layer underneath `SqlClient`: it executes
 * already-compiled SQL with positional parameters and exposes transformed row
 * results, raw driver results, streams, value arrays, and unprepared statement
 * execution. Most applications should work through `SqlClient`, while driver
 * integrations and advanced code use this module to provide scoped connection
 * acquisition, implement pooling, reserve a connection for a workflow, or adapt
 * a dialect-specific client into Effect.
 *
 * Connections are resources and should be acquired through an `Acquirer` in a
 * `Scope` so pool checkout, transaction pinning, and release semantics are
 * preserved. Transaction coordination lives at the `SqlClient` layer, so mixing
 * manually reserved connections with transactional client queries can bypass the
 * expected atomic boundary. Raw, unprepared, streaming, parameter, and row
 * transformation behavior ultimately comes from the driver and dialect; check
 * each integration for differences in placeholders, prepared statement support,
 * cursor lifetime, and result shapes.
