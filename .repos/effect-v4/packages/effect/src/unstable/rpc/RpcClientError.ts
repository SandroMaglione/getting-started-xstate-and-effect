/**
 * Shared error types for the RPC client protocol layer.
 *
 * This module defines the client-side failures added to schema-aware RPC
 * clients. `RpcClientError` wraps transport failures from the built-in HTTP,
 * socket, and worker protocols, while `RpcClientDefect` records protocol
 * problems such as empty HTTP responses, malformed response batches, failed
 * transport decoding, or unexpected connection failures.
 *
 * These errors are separate from a remote handler's typed error. Remote
 * failures that match an RPC's error schema are decoded from the RPC exit and
 * remain part of the procedure's domain error channel. Server defects and
 * schema mismatches are not normal remote errors: they surface as defects or
 * protocol failures, so handlers commonly inspect `RpcClientError.reason` to
 * decide whether a failure is retryable transport trouble or an incompatible
 * client/server schema or serialization boundary.
