/**
 * Provides an `HttpClient` implementation backed by the Web Fetch API.
 *
 * Use this module when an application should run HTTP requests through the
 * platform's `fetch` implementation, such as browser code, edge runtimes, or
 * Node.js environments that provide `globalThis.fetch`. The `Fetch` reference
 * allows tests and custom runtimes to supply a different fetch function, while
 * `RequestInit` can provide defaults such as credentials, redirect behavior,
 * cache mode, or other platform-specific fetch options.
 *
 * The client translates Effect HTTP requests into fetch calls and wraps Web
 * `Response` values as `HttpClientResponse`s. Fetch implementations control
 * details such as CORS, cookies, redirect handling, and abort semantics, so
 * behavior can vary by platform. Stream request bodies are sent as Web streams
 * with `duplex: "half"` for runtimes that require it, and `content-length` is
 * omitted so fetch can manage body framing itself.
 *
