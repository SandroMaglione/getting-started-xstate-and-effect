/**
 * The `ScopedRef` module provides a mutable reference for values that are tied
 * to scoped resources. Each value stored in a `ScopedRef` is acquired within its
 * own `Scope`, and replacing the value safely releases the resources associated
 * with the previous value.
 *
 * Use `ScopedRef` when an application needs to keep a current resource-backed
 * value, such as a live client, connection, subscription, or cached handle, and
 * later swap it for a newly acquired value without leaking the old resources.
 * Reads are simple, while updates are synchronized and resource-safe.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - A `ScopedRef` must itself be created and used within a `Scope`; when that
 *   scope closes, the currently stored value is finalized.
 * - Use {@link fromAcquire} or {@link set} for resourceful values so acquisition
 *   and finalization are tracked correctly.
 * - Use {@link make} only for values that do not acquire resources.
 * - Updating a `ScopedRef` waits for the replacement acquisition and old
 *   finalization to complete before returning.
