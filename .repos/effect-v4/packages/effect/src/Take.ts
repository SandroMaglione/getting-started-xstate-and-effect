/**
 * The `Take` module provides the representation used by stream-like producers
 * to describe a single pull result. A `Take<A, E, Done>` is either a
 * non-empty batch of emitted values, a failed `Exit`, or a successful `Exit`
 * carrying the stream's completion value.
 *
 * `Take` is useful at boundaries where pull results need to be stored,
 * transferred, or interpreted later while preserving the distinction between
 * emitted elements, failures, and normal completion. Use {@link toPull} to turn
 * a `Take` back into a `Pull`: value batches become successful pulls, failure
 * exits are propagated, and successful exits signal completion with `Done`.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - A value batch is always represented by a `NonEmptyReadonlyArray`; empty
 *   batches are not valid `Take` values.
 * - Successful `Exit` values do not emit elements. They represent pull
 *   completion and carry the `Done` value.
