/**
 * The `Queue` module provides asynchronous queues for communicating between
 * fibers. A `Queue<A, E>` can receive values of type `A`, deliver them to
 * consumers in order, and eventually complete or fail with an error of type
 * `E`.
 *
 * **Mental model**
 *
 * - A queue is a fiber-aware channel with one write side ({@link Enqueue}) and
 *   one read side ({@link Dequeue})
 * - Producers add values with {@link offer} or {@link offerAll}; consumers
 *   remove values with {@link take}, {@link takeN}, {@link takeBetween}, or
 *   {@link takeAll}
 * - Bounded queues use an overflow strategy: {@link bounded} suspends
 *   producers, {@link dropping} rejects new values, and {@link sliding} drops
 *   old values
 * - Queues can be completed with {@link end}, failed with {@link fail} or
 *   {@link failCause}, interrupted with {@link interrupt}, and shut down with
 *   {@link shutdown}
 * - Operations are expressed as `Effect` values so waiting producers and
 *   consumers compose with interruption, scheduling, and structured
 *   concurrency
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Create queues: {@link make}, {@link bounded}, {@link dropping},
 *   {@link sliding}, {@link unbounded}
 * - Restrict capabilities: {@link asEnqueue}, {@link asDequeue}
 * - Produce values: {@link offer}, {@link offerAll}
 * - Consume values: {@link take}, {@link takeN}, {@link takeBetween},
 *   {@link takeAll}, {@link poll}, {@link peek}
 * - Drain or reset buffered values: {@link collect}, {@link clear}
 * - Signal lifecycle: {@link end}, {@link fail}, {@link failCause},
 *   {@link interrupt}, {@link shutdown}
 * - Inspect state: {@link size}, {@link isFull}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - `take` waits when the queue is empty; use {@link poll} when absence should
 *   be represented as `Option.None`
 * - `dropping` and `sliding` queues can lose values by design; use
 *   {@link bounded} when every offered value must be preserved
 * - Completion and failure are observed by consumers through the queue's error
 *   channel, so include `Cause.Done` in the error type when using {@link end}
 * - The `Unsafe` variants are synchronous, low-level operations; prefer the
 *   effectful APIs in application code
 *
 * **See also**
 *
 * - {@link Enqueue} for write-only queue handles
 * - {@link Dequeue} for read-only queue handles
 * - {@link Pull} for stream-style completion errors
