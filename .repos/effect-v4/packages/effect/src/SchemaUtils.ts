/**
 * The `SchemaUtils` module contains focused helpers for schema patterns that
 * are useful but too specialized for the core `Schema` API surface.
 *
 * Use this module when you need to describe a native class with a schema while
 * keeping a plain struct as its encoded representation. This is especially
 * useful for classes such as `Data.Error` subclasses that should decode from
 * structured data, encode back to that data, and still preserve class identity
 * for instance checks and schema optics.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - The constructor is called with the decoded struct fields as a single
 *   argument, so the class constructor must accept that shape.
 * - Encoding uses the instance itself as the encoded shape, so the instance
 *   should expose properties compatible with the provided struct schema.
 *
