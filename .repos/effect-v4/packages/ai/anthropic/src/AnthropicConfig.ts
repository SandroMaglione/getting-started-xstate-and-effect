/**
 * The `AnthropicConfig` module provides contextual configuration for the
 * Anthropic AI provider integration. It is used to customize the generated
 * Anthropic HTTP client without changing individual request code.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Provide a shared `HttpClient` transformation for Anthropic requests
 * - Add provider-specific concerns such as request instrumentation, proxying,
 *   retries, or header manipulation
 * - Scope a client transformation to a single effect with {@link withClientTransform}
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Configuration is read from the Effect context, so overrides only apply to
 *   effects run inside the configured scope
 * - `withClientTransform` replaces the current `transformClient` value while
 *   preserving any other Anthropic configuration fields
