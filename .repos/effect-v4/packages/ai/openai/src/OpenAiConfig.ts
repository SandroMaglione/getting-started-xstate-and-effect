/**
 * The `OpenAiConfig` module provides contextual configuration for the
 * `@effect/ai-openai` integration. It is used to customize how OpenAI clients
 * are built and interpreted without threading configuration through every API
 * call manually.
 *
 * The primary use case is installing an HTTP client transform with
 * {@link withClientTransform}. This lets applications adapt the underlying
 * OpenAI HTTP client for cross-cutting concerns such as custom middleware,
 * instrumentation, proxying, or request policy changes while keeping the
 * OpenAI service APIs unchanged.
 *
 * Configuration is scoped through Effect's context, so transforms only apply to
 * the effect they are provided to and anything evaluated inside that scope.
 * When multiple transforms are needed, compose them into a single
 * `HttpClient => HttpClient` function before providing the configuration.
