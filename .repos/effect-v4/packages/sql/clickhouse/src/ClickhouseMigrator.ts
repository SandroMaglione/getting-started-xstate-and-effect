/**
 * Utilities for applying Effect SQL migrations to ClickHouse databases.
 *
 * This module re-exports the shared `Migrator` loaders and error types, then
 * provides `run` and `layer` helpers for applying ordered migrations through
 * the current ClickHouse `SqlClient`. It is typically used during application
 * startup, deployment, or integration tests that need to prepare analytical
 * tables before dependent services begin reading or writing data.
 *
 * Applied migrations are stored in `effect_sql_migrations` by default and use
 * the shared `<id>_<name>` loader convention. Only migrations with ids greater
 * than the latest recorded id are run. ClickHouse schema changes often depend
 * on engine, `ORDER BY`, database, and cluster settings, and many deployments
 * rely on explicit `ON CLUSTER` clauses or coordinated rollout tooling. This
 * adapter does not add a ClickHouse-specific table lock or schema dumper, so
 * coordinate concurrent migrators and do not expect `schemaDirectory` to emit a
 * ClickHouse schema snapshot.
