/**
 * Serves Swagger UI for an `HttpApi` by rendering the OpenAPI document generated
 * from the API directly into an HTML page.
 *
 * Use this module when you want a lightweight documentation route for a running
 * `HttpApi`, typically in development, staging, internal consoles, or public API
 * reference pages where Swagger UI's exploration and request-building tools are
 * preferred. The exported `layer` adds a `GET` route to an `HttpRouter`,
 * defaults the mount path to `/docs`, and leaves API implementation and server
 * wiring to `HttpApiBuilder` and the surrounding router layers.
 *
 * The page is self-contained: `OpenApi.fromApi` derives the specification from
 * the API's groups, endpoints, schemas, and OpenAPI annotations, then the JSON
 * is embedded into the HTML served to the browser. No separate `/openapi.json`
 * endpoint is installed by this module, so clients or documentation pipelines
 * that need the raw spec should use `OpenApi.fromApi` directly or expose a JSON
 * route elsewhere. If the docs are public, mount the layer behind the same
 * routing, security, or environment controls you want for the UI; generated
 * server URLs and operation metadata come from the API's OpenAPI annotations.
 *
