/**
 * The `HttpApiTest` module provides helpers for testing `HttpApi`
 * implementations through the generated client interface without starting an
 * HTTP server.
 *
 * Use this module when a test should exercise one or more implemented API
 * groups with the same request encoding, routing, response encoding, and client
 * decoding used by the production `HttpApiBuilder` and `HttpApiClient`
 * pipeline. This is useful for focused handler tests, schema round-trip checks,
 * middleware behavior, and tests that want to call an API through its typed
 * client while keeping all traffic in memory.
 *
 * The selected groups must be provided in the test environment, usually by
 * supplying the corresponding `HttpApiBuilder.group` layers. Groups that are not
 * selected are still present on the returned client shape, but their handlers
 * are placeholders that die if called, which helps catch accidental calls outside
 * the test scope. The generated client is still a real `HttpApiClient`, so
 * endpoint middleware, client middleware, platform services, and the optional
 * `baseUrl` used for URL construction follow the same rules as normal clients;
 * only the HTTP transport is replaced with an in-memory router dispatch.
 *
