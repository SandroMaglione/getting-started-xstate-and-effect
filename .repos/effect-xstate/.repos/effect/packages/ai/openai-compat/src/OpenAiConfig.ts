/**
 * The `OpenAiConfig` module provides shared configuration for clients that
 * talk to OpenAI-compatible APIs. It is used to customize the HTTP client
 * wiring around a provider without changing the higher-level model,
 * embeddings, or tool-calling APIs that consume the client.
 *
 * **Common tasks**
 *
 * - Install a client transform with {@link withClientTransform}
 * - Add provider-specific HTTP behavior, such as headers, retries, proxies, or
 *   instrumentation
 * - Read the active configuration from the Effect context when implementing
 *   OpenAI-compatible integrations
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - The transform receives and returns an `HttpClient`, so it should preserve
 *   the existing client behavior unless it intentionally replaces it
 * - Configuration is provided through Effect context and is scoped to the
 *   effect that receives the service
