## Project structure
The project contains 2 folders:
- [`first-example`](./first-example/): My initial exploration with all the features of XState and state machines. I was specifically interested in working with types to try making the machine as type-safe as possible
- [`audio-player-react`](./audio-player-react/): This is the implementation of the weekly project. It contains a Vite app that uses **XState and Effect to implement and audio player** (`<audio>`)
  - [`machine.ts`](./audio-player-react/src/machine.ts): XState machine
  - [`effect.ts`](/audio-player-react/src/effect.ts): actions of the machine implemented using Effect
  - [`App.tsx`](/audio-player-react/src/App.tsx): react component that uses the state machine to render the audio player and send events
